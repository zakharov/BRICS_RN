	BRICS_3D is the BRICS library for 3D perception and modeling. It offers perception
	algorithms to create a processing chain for object recognition or environment reconstruction 
	(e.g. triangle representation) via data from 3D sensors. 
	
	Beside the algorithms for perception the BRICS_3D library implements a novel scene graph based
	world modeling approach to maintain the processed 3D data over a longer period of time.	 
	This library is biased towards 3D perception and modeling for mobile manipulation applications.
